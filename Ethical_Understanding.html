          <h3>Health: Investigation Response</h3>
          <p>This assignment required me to create an infographic highlighting how human behaviour can negatively affect the world. I chose to focus on how humans influence/increase in invasive species. The purpose of the infographic was to educate people and explain how human activity can have unethical consequences. To do this, I focused on two main ideas; how invasive species can affect the environment and how they can affect humans. Focusing on both of these allowed me to explore a wider range of ethical concepts such as morals, justice, equality, and rights. Connecting these concepts to a real-world issue allowed me to investigate in more depth. I learned that how human activity can have a run-on effect creating more ethical concerns. I also learned how to identify and expand on these concepts.</p>
          <h3>Essentials Workbook</h3>
          <p>Biology is a subject riddled with ethical concepts. Throughout the year, I have developed my ability to identify and analyse ethical concepts. This is because although it is important to understand the scientific concepts that reside in biology is also necessary to understand the ethics that come with it. If you cannot understand the ethics related to biology, it is almost impossible to apply biological knowledge in real-world situations. If you cannot apply knowledge it is essentially useless. In the Essentials workbook, there are sections called “capability boxes” which pose capability based questions relating to the topic covered in that particular chapter. Many of these are based on ethical understanding capability. Although we are not required to answer these questions, it is usually useful to read them try to answer them anyway. This is because it gives me a deeper understanding of biology as a whole. As an added bonus similar questions are used in the tests.</p>

          <h3>Science: Social Issues</h3>
          <p>A biodiversity task required me to think ethically about genetic diseases. I was given a scenario where a couple (Jack and Diane) wanted a child, however, Diane might have been a carrier of DMD. I needed to play out the scenario by taking the role of a doctor, a genetic counsellor, and Jack and Diane. As the counsellor and the doctor, I was gathering background information regarding the chance of passing on the disease and its effects. At the end, I created a debate between Jack and Diane as to whether or not they should take the risk. Each argument that I made incorporated one aspect of medical ethics; those being autonomy, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Because I was debating for both sides I needed to expand my thinking and try to limit my own biasness. I needed to understand other people’s perspectives and beliefs on the issue. From this task, I learned how to use facts and ethics together in order to find the best possible solution to complex issues.</p>

          <h3>Physics SHE Task</h3>
          <p>The purpose of the assignment was to display the connections between science and society in a particular area of physics of our choice. I decided to focus on quantum mechanics and magnetism. I used the creation of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in order to highlight these connections. The primary connections that I talked about were how advances in quantum mechanics can influence and be influenced by other areas of science, technology and engineering. I also looked at how scientific knowledge, understanding, and inquiry can enable scientists to develop solutions, make discoveries, design action for sustainability, evaluate economic, social impacts, and offer valid explanations. I have written many SHE tasks before, however, never in as much detail as this one. Due to this, I was able to explore the ethics that were involved in the development and application of MRI technology. This included comparing the advantages against the disadvantages. The primary negative implications that I focused on was the high cost of the technology. This is because it leads to further ethical issues such as is this available to everyone and if not, is anything being done to change this.</p>

          <h3>Science: Hallett Cove Trip</h3>
          <p>In a group task, we needed to create a presentation about Hallett Cove’s geological history. This came with many issues though. While gathering information and creating the presentation, the group continued to disagree. It was a struggle to keep everyone focused and working together. This led to everyone doing it how they thought was best rather than as a group. As we neared the due date we did not have a solid piece of work to hand up. At this point I decided that we needed to regroup and find a solution. During this time I tried my best to make sure that everyone had their point of view recognised. This helped to make the other group member(s) become more understanding. Once we came to a conclusion that fit everyone’s ideas the best we needed to finish the work as fast as possible. To do this we all decided on our responsibilities and made sure we stuck to them. I now have more confidence in trying to make people understand the perspectives of others.</p>
          <h3>Chemistry Practical Report</h3>
          <p>One particular assignment in chemistry required me to compare the acidity of multiple soft drinks. In the discussion section of the report, I wrote a small paragraph on future research that could be done on the topic of soda acidity. I suggested that the effects of (soda) acidity on the body should be researched further in order to apply the knowledge found in the report. I touched on how current research suggests that the people are consuming a higher quantity of acidic foods and that this may be a catalyst for a variety of health issues. I wrote a quick overview of the responsibilities that would/should be placed on governments and companies in order to mitigate these effects in the future. These responsibilities would be created because this new knowledge would present currently unforeseen issues that affect a large portion of society. For example, one responsibility would be to educate people on the effects of drinking large amounts of soft drinks and/or soft that are highly acidic. I stated this because people should have the right to be aware of the risks that they may be taking. Therefore, they can knowingly make informed decisions.</p>
