          <h3>Health: Investigation Response</h3>
          <p>This assignment required me to create an infographic highlighting how human behaviour can negatively affect the world. I chose to focus on how humans influence/increase in invasive species. The purpose of the infographic was to educate people and explain how human activity can have unethical consequences. To do this, I focused on two main ideas; how invasive species can affect the environment and how they can affect humans. Focusing on both of these allowed me to explore a wider range of ethical concepts such as morals, justice, equality, and rights. Connecting these concepts to a real-world issue allowed me to investigate in more depth. I learned that how human activity can have a run-on effect creating more ethical concerns. I also learned how to identify and expand on these concepts.</p>

          <h3>Science: Social Issues</h3>
          <p>A biodiversity task required me to think ethically about genetic diseases. I was given a scenario where a couple (Jack and Diane) wanted a child, however, Diane might have been a carrier of DMD. I needed to play out the scenario by taking the role of a doctor, a genetic counsellor, and Jack and Diane. As the counsellor and the doctor, I was gathering background information regarding the chance of passing on the disease and its effects. At the end, I created a debate between Jack and Diane as to whether or not they should take the risk. Each argument that I made incorporated one aspect of medical ethics; those being autonomy, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Because I was debating for both sides I needed to expand my thinking and try to limit my own biasness. I needed to understand other peopleâ€™s perspectives and beliefs on the issue. From this task, I learned how to use facts and ethics together in order to find the best possible solution to complex issues.</p>

          <h3>E&C SAT </h3>
          <p>The first assessment for E&C (Earth & Cosmos) was a SAT in which we needed to explain why one specific factor of the Earth was the most important for the development and sustainability of life. I was given &quot;the stability, age, and size of our Sun.&quot; In order to show the importance of the sun and its attributes, I described three of its processes. Describing the processes required me to alter my some of my vocabulary. For example, while trying to explain how the sun releases heat and light, some of the words were a bit too complex so I needed to change my language. I also did not want to write in a way that was too dumbed down. I also had to rely of my spelling and grammar as there was not enough time to continuously go back and proofread my work.</p>

          <h3>Advertisement analysis</h3>
          <p>One of my best pieces of work would have to be my advertisement analyses. This assignment required me to look at two commercials and compare how they use stereotypes to grab the attention of the intended audience. I found that although the narration/audio did help, the visuals were the most crucial part. I also realised that both of the commercials had more depth than what could be seen at first glance. In order to understand more about the ads, I researched how similar ads used visual elements to hook their audience. I found that a lot of what other people found was present in the commercials I was studying, however, I think that these other also analysis missed quite a bit. The most challenging part was trying to understand my second advertisement (a perfume ad). Because I am not the intended audience, I did not understand some of the messages and subtle visual cues. I had watched the entirety of the ad multiple times trying to reason why each element was present. After a while, I began to realise how they were manipulating natural instincts and desires. I learned that although the ads we see appear to be somewhat random, they are actually made with a lot of thought and meaning.</p>
