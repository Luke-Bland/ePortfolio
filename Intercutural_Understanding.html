          <h3>ASMS Community</h3>
          <p>The ASMS is a very open environment and contains a lot of people from very different backgrounds. One of the best traits of the school is that everyone is affable. Therefore, it is very easy to create relationships with peers. On top of this, the ASMS contains people from a wide variety of backgrounds. This has led to me becoming friends with a lot of people who I may not have otherwise. It provides an opportunity to learn about other people’s backgrounds and beliefs.</p>

          <h3>Land rights speech</h3>
          <p>In year eleven, I was presented a task in which I needed to write a persuasive speech from the point of view of someone throughout history. I had chosen to take the place of an indigenous Australian during 1966. My speech was arguing for the return of aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. To do this, I needed to research the social and legal implications that were affecting the indigenous people at the time. This allowed me to gain a better understanding of how they would have felt during this period of time. Learning more about their beliefs allowed me to provide better points for the reclaiming of the land. For example, many communities believe that time is not linear in the way that many other cultures do. Instead, many perceive it as circular and that the “current point of time” is simply in the centre of other times. This can greatly impact their views of the “past” as many believe that events of great significant are closer than others. Therefore, they still feel greatly affected by the invasion of their land, as though it has just happened.  Despite this concept being somewhat inconceivable to me, was still able to empathise with the emotions that some indigenous people would have been feeling. I could then use this understanding to make my speech more powerful and meaningful.</p>

          <h3>International Science Fair</h3>
          <p>On week seven, term three each year, the ASMS conducts International Science Fair (ISF). During this week, the ASMS invites partner schools to take part in challenge based learning activities. These schools include schools within SA, interstate as well as international. As would be expected, this allowed for me to meet a lot of new people, many of which were from other countries. We were split up into multiple groups, each of which contained was based on an idea or plan. We were able to choose which groups we were put into. The group that I was in was called “save the world B4 it’s too late.” The purpose of our group was to redesign the ASMS community garden, allowing for it to provide a habitat for a range of local wildlife. We then had to implement our design by doing physical work. It was an interesting experience because the task required us to work with some people who spoke very little English. This required students from the ASMS as well as the international students to find creative ways of overcoming this language barrier. By the end of the week we had accomplished our goal and made new friends doing so.</p>

          <h3>Prac Design</h3>
          <p>In Medical Engineering, we were put into groups in which we would solve a medical issue via an innovative apparatus. We made a prototype of a bionic arm made specifically for athletes. In order to improve our design, we created and performed a practical. This practical was created to investigate the relationship between arm length and throwing distance of a ball. Although this was a simple experiment, we still needed to go through the designing process. From this, I learned how to write a logical hypothesis by using information available to me. Creating the procedure required me to think about the purpose of the practical and how I can best fulfill it. I then needed to write it in a clear and precise way that could be understood by people new to the practical. Once I had completed the practical I needed to analyse the results. The results were not exactly what I had expected. This meant that I had to find an explanation for the unforeseen outcome. I applied the results to the design of the bionic arm, taking into account the change in what was predicted. My work surrounding this practical can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQIKbK40YKewh4mwxbfy5kUQmec6y45qs3XwfzMupg4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
