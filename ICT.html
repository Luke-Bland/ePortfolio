        <h3>3D Modelling/Printing</h3>
        <p>Throughout Dream, Design and Develop, I have had to become accustomed to using programs such as SketchUp to design 3D models. I started simple by creating a die. To make it more interesting I worked with Matthew Lopez. We designed two dice so that each side could interlock with the corresponding die. Although this was a simple design, I gained valuable experience on how to use the software. This included learning the tools, techniques, processes required to design in 3D. From this, I was then able to move on to more complex designs. In a group task, three other students and I designed and printed a mug that does not burn you. Making it involved more precise measurements and more innovative designing.  We needed to think about the logistics, the appearance, and the process when creating the mug. The next step in developing this skill would be to create mechanical objects.</p>
        <h3>Video Analysis</h3>
        <p>While writing a practical report in physics, I relied on the use of a range of programs to gather, create and present data. The purpose of the practical was to find the effect of a projectiles cross sectional area on its horizontal range when launched perpendicular to the ground at a given height and velocity. It was difficult to gather much data without the aid of a video analysis program. Therefore, to determine the exact velocity, angle and motion of the projectiles, videos of the experiments were uploaded to a program called ‘Tracker.’ In order for it to work, the specific details of the setup must be entered. This includes one or more points of reference that provides a scale for Tracker to work with. It also requires axes to provide a frame of reference. Once this is done it is possible to make Tracker follow the motion of the projectile. Using the information provided, Tracker is able to calculate the values of the variables mentioned previously. With this new data, it was possible to calculate the approximate drag experienced by each projectile. Therefore, a correlation between the size of the projectile and the drag it would experience would be determined. Creating graphs on this data showed this correlation in a way that was easier to interpret.</p>

        <h3>Email Etiquette</h3>
        <p>Over the past year and a half, I have had to learn proper email etiquette. I have found it useful for both formal and informal emails. I have learned how to structure emails and how to address the people I&#8217;m emailing. The first email that I sent, other than those to teachers and work colleagues was to NVRI (National Vision Research Institute) regarding their research. At the time I did not feel confident in writing it. Looking back on it I realise that I made a lot of mistakes. The main issue was that I did not address the professors/doctors/etc. by their title. After I had emailed some of the people working their (including the director of the NVRI) I began to write more formally. After this experience, I have the ability and the confidence to email people of high significance.</p>
        <h3>ePortfolio</h3>
        <p>The creation of this ePortfolio relies heavily on the use of ICT. Before working on it, I had no experience in creating a webpage. Therefore, I relied on the help of others to point me in the right direction. I first had to learn how create the webpage itself. I found out that you could use GitHub to host the webpage. I was then able to create the homepage by using premade template, however, the layout did not fit the ePortfolio. In order to fix this I needed to change the way it was originally coded. To do this I needed to actually understand the coding. I learned that it was constructed from HTML (hypertext mark-up language). Using a website called Codecademy, I was able learn the basics required to insert text, rearrange structure, and create simple functions. This allowed me to create text boxes which could be clicked on to send the viewer to appendices. I made an appendix for each capability. Therefore, the information contained in the ePortfolio is easier to find and access. However, these while creating these appendices, I quickly realised that HTML relies on the assistance of CSS (cascading style sheets) to create a visually appealing design. I began to look into CSS so that I could improve the design, however, CSS proved to be much more complicated than HTML. Therefore, I had decided that it was not worth the time it would take to learn as it meant that I would have less time to input the actual information featured in the webpage. </p>

        <h3>OFC Election Math Folio</h3>
        <p>In Order From Chaos, we were required to predict the winner of the 2018 state election. In order to do this, I focused on the King electorate as it was the most marginal seat. It was a new district so I had to look at previous electoral outcomes in the area along with its demographics to predict whether the majority will vote Labor or Liberal. During the folio, I have become adept at using a range of functions in excel. I am able to collect and sort data in a meaningful and useable way. Functions that I have learned include calculating; mean/median/mode, midpoint, standard deviation, and variance of ranged data sets. Evidence of my learning can be found

        I proceeded to compare the data I found with two other sets I created showing the demographics of strong Liberal and strong Labor electorates. This allowed me to create justified and logical arguments in order to support my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILAfniSMKuvfWTSCsbI-X7Ie_9F5OVHHrZ1JgL904Xs/edit?usp=sharing">prediction</a>.</p>
        <h3>OFC Election Math Folio</h3>
        <p>In chemistry, I was required to write a SHE task on a topic of my choice. I began by brainstorming range of topics which we had covered so far in the year. I began researching these topics further to see how they are currently being applied and/or how they might be applied in the future. I started by simply looking at articles released by news/magazine websites. This allowed me to get a broad idea of the areas I might like to focus on. I found an articles referencing the use of polymers in drug delivery and decided to base my question on that that topic. Once I had my question I could begin to conduct more in depth research. I first used google scholar to search key points in the question I was looking at. This included things such as past, current and future applications as well as economic, social and ethical factors that come with polymeric drug delivery systems. From this I was able to find data, information and opinions that allowed me to write an informed report. While choosing which resources to collect this information from, I needed to determine the suitability, credibility, reliability, validity and bias of each source.</p>
