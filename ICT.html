        <h3>3D Modelling/Printing</h3>
        <p>Throughout Dream, Design and Develop, I have had to become accustomed to using programs such as SketchUp to design 3D models. I started simple by creating a die. To make it more interesting I worked with Matthew Lopez. We designed two dice so that each side could interlock with the corresponding die. Although this was a simple design, I gained valuable experience on how to use the software. This included learning the tools, techniques, processes required to design in 3D. From this, I was then able to move on to more complex designs. In a group task, three other students and I designed and printed a mug that does not burn you. Making it involved more precise measurements and more innovative designing.  We needed to think about the logistics, the appearance, and the process when creating the mug. The next step in developing this skill would be to create mechanical objects.</p>

        <h3>Email Etiquette</h3>
          <p>Over the past year and a half, I have had to learn proper email etiquette. I have found it useful for both formal and informal emails. I have learned how to structure emails and how to address the people I&#8217;m emailing. The first email that I sent, other than those to teachers and work colleagues was to NVRI (National Vision Research Institute) regarding their research. At the time I did not feel confident in writing it. Looking back on it I realise that I made a lot of mistakes. The main issue was that I did not address the professors/doctors/etc. by their title. After I had emailed some of the people working their (including the director of the NVRI) I began to write more formally. After this experience, I have the ability and the confidence to email people of high significance.</p>

        <h3>OFC Election Math Folio</h3>
        <p>In Order From Chaos, we were required to predict the winner of the 2018 state election. In order to do this, I focused on the King electorate as it was the most marginal seat. It was a new district so I had to look at previous electoral outcomes in the area along with its demographics to predict whether the majority will vote Labor or Liberal. During the folio, I have become adept at using a range of functions in excel. I am able to collect and sort data in a meaningful and useable way. Functions that I have learned include calculating; mean/median/mode, midpoint, standard deviation, and variance of ranged data sets. Evidence of my learning can be found

        I proceeded to compare the data I found with two other sets I created showing the demographics of strong Liberal and strong Labor electorates. This allowed me to create justified and logical arguments in order to support my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILAfniSMKuvfWTSCsbI-X7Ie_9F5OVHHrZ1JgL904Xs/edit?usp=sharing">prediction</a>.</p>
