          <h3>Chemistry</h3>
          <p>While teaching myself chemistry I have had to become adept at using these mathematical concepts.  One instance where I had to use fractions, percentages and rates was when I was learning stoichiometry (determining quantities of reactants and products). I was quickly able to understand the concepts required to calculate stoichiometry, however, remembering and applying that understanding was more difficult. Depending on the problem you are trying to solve, the process can be somewhat long. Therefore you must be extra careful as to not make a mistake. I was then able to carry these skills over to other topics such as calculating partial pressure and measuring equilibrium. I am not yet finished learning chemistry so I will continue to develop these skills in other areas of learning. I am certain that I will also be able to apply these skills outside of my own learning. They will be valuable in my schooling career as well as everyday life.</p>

          <h3>Chemistry Part 2</h3>
          <p>Just like everyone, I use measurements in everyday life, however, I have found that chemistry requires an understanding of a wide variety of measurements. Much of the measurements that I have been using are commonplace in everyday life. For example, volume, pressure, weight and temperature. However, the ways in which I have been using them are unique to chemistry and physics. I have learned to convert between different units of measurement as well as how to determine how different types of measurements affect one another. For example, PV=nRT. From this equation is possible to determine how changing one value will consequently affect others. I have also had to learn new types of measurements such as moles, frequencies, charge, and so on. The final important skill that I have developed is comprehending (as well as possible) minuscule values such as an atomic unit..</p>

          <h3>Research Project Data Collection</h3>
          <p>For my research project, I looked at how various ant species respond to the presence of oleic acid. I knew that at least one ant species used it to indicate the death of a colony member. To test the response of multiple species I created a template for a graph which displayed each species and their response over a three week period. I collected and inserted the data into the graph, however, the results were unexpected. At first glance, I could not see any patterns or reasoning behind the data. However, after looking through it for a while longer I was able to form some logical conclusions based on the graph. I was also able to use data collected by other people to support my conclusions.</p>

          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <p>As mentioned in a previous capability (social management) I have done work experience in a local veterinary clinic. My main objective was to develop skills in a social context, however, this in turn allowed me to develop a wide range of capabilities. This was because I was fortunate enough to be given a variety of responsibilities. Some of these required me to be comfortable calculating with whole numbers. For example, I was required to continuously check the patientâ€™s heart rate. This could be done quickly by counting the beats over a short period of time and multiplying it. Another important task that required me to use calculations was determining the dosages needed for specific patients. I needed to take the weight and breed of the animal into account as well as the type drug being used. The final main task that required numeracy was calculating the prices of medicines, surgeries, etc. Thanks to the range of responsibilities I received I have developed many capabilities which will be valuable to me for the rest of my life.</p>
