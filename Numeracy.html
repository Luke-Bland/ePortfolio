          <h3>Chemistry</h3>
          <p>While teaching myself chemistry I have had to become adept at using these mathematical concepts.  One instance where I had to use fractions, percentages and rates was when I was learning stoichiometry (determining quantities of reactants and products). I was quickly able to understand the concepts required to calculate stoichiometry, however, remembering and applying that understanding was more difficult. Depending of the problem you are trying to solve, the process can be somewhat long. Therefore you must be extra careful as to not make a mistake. I was then able to carry these skills over to other topics such as calculating partial pressure and measuring equilibrium. I am not yet finished learning chemistry so I will continue to develop these skills in other areas of learning. I am certain that I will also be able to apply these skills outside of my own learning. They be valuable in my schooling career as well as everyday life.</p>

          <h3>SIP Planning</h3>
          <p>For SIP (student inquiry project) students needed to create a question that we would develop and explore in depth over the next 20 weeks. Possibly the most challenging part was creating an idea that had enough substance to continue working on throughout the entire timespan. In order to create the question, I began simple by thinking of some topics (such as biology, medicine, etc.) that interested me. In each topic, I looked at whether there were sub&#8208;topics (such as animal behaviour, selective breeding, etc.) that could be expanded on in order to create realistic and worthwhile questions. By doing this I narrowed down my search to just a few possible questions. In the end, I chose to look at goldfish memory. However, I realised that goldfish memory was still very broad. So, I created sub&#8208;questions about goldfish in general that I could add to create a more specific question. I decided to look at how colour plays a role in the development of goldfish memory. I ended up with the question &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BjqNZ6F9sg7FOaT68jC-hOcjPeqk9dAIG_TfF-kibbY/edit?usp=sharing">Can goldfish utilise colour in order to develop memory and how long can they retain that memory?</a>&quot; This practice in brainstorming will continue to help me develop new and creative ideas in the future and will also be useful when starting my RP (research project).</p>

          <h3>SIP Reflection</h3>
          <p>Another important part of SIP is the reflection. Once I had finished the folio and the outcome of my SIP, I wrote a reflection on the journey and what I had learned along the way. This included developing research skills, practical skills, and evaluation skills. The reflection helped me to understand my personal research and learning methods. Recapping what I learned and did has solidified what I need to prepare for in RP. While writing my reflection, I developed my metacognition. I thought about how I thought throughout SIP. Doing so has allowed me to plan future assignments as I know how I like to go about things.</p>

          <h3>Prac Design</h3>
          <p>In Medical Engineering, we were put into groups in which we would solve a medical issue via an innovative apparatus. We made a prototype of a bionic arm made specifically for athletes. In order to improve our design, we created and performed a practical. This practical was created to investigate the relationship between arm length and throwing distance of a ball. Although this was a simple experiment, we still needed to go through the designing process. From this, I learned how to write a logical hypothesis by using information available to me. Creating the procedure required me to think about the purpose of the practical and how I can best fulfill it. I then needed to write it in a clear and precise way that could be understood by people new to the practical. Once I had completed the practical I needed to analyse the results. The results were not exactly what I had expected. This meant that I had to find an explanation for the unforeseen outcome. I applied the results to the design of the bionic arm, taking into account the change in what was predicted. My work surrounding this practical can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQIKbK40YKewh4mwxbfy5kUQmec6y45qs3XwfzMupg4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
