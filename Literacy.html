          <h3>Persuasive speech</h3>
          <p>One of the first assignments for year eleven was a persuasive speech. We were allowed to choose a social issue/topic and either support or refute it. I chose to support land rights for aboriginals in the context of the late 80&apos;s to early 90&apos;s. While writing the speech I had looked at famous speeches, primarily those based on human rights, and I wrote notes about how they were structured. I incorporated many of these ideas into my speech with my own twist. I started by putting the basics into my speech such as a clear thesis statement and ordered arguments and a conclusion. In order to make these paragraphs strong and remain captivating, I added more specific writing techniques such as repetition and allusion. The final part of my writing included persuasive techniques that were written to directly impact the audience, such as emotive word choices, rhetorical questions, and patriotism. Once I finished writing it I then had to perform it. To make it as effective as possible I added pauses and emphasis in places that would benefit from it. This experience has given me a better understanding of how to incorporate these techniques in a way which allows for the speech to flow as well as have the intended impact.</p>

          <h3>Indigenous knowledge</h3>
          <p>I have improved my grammar throughout all of my assignments, however, the best example of this would be my Indigenous Knowledge assignment. For Biodiversity, we looked at how the knowledge and practices of Indigenous people have helped in the progression of the modern world. While writing my assignment I covered a range of topics such as chemistry, astronomy, religion, and agriculture. I found that my sentence structures changed depending on the point I was trying to convey. I also needed to avoid sentence fragments, run-on sentences, and faulty construction. Writing in this manner made my work clearer whilst also giving it more credibility.</p>

          <h3>E&C SAT </h3>
          <p>The first assessment for E&C (Earth & Cosmos) was a SAT in which we needed to explain why one specific factor of the Earth was the most important for the development and sustainability of life. I was given &quot;the stability, age, and size of our Sun.&quot; In order to show the importance of the sun and its attributes, I described three of its processes. Describing the processes required me to alter my some of my vocabulary. For example, while trying to explain how the sun releases heat and light, some of the words were a bit too complex so I needed to change my language. I also did not want to write in a way that was too dumbed down. I also had to rely of my spelling and grammar as there was not enough time to continuously go back and proofread my work.</p>

          <h3>Advertisement analysis</h3>
          <p>One of my best pieces of work would have to be my advertisement analyses. This assignment required me to look at two commercials and compare how they use stereotypes to grab the attention of the intended audience. I found that although the narration/audio did help, the visuals were the most crucial part. I also realised that both of the commercials had more depth than what could be seen at first glance. In order to understand more about the ads, I researched how similar ads used visual elements to hook their audience. I found that a lot of what other people found was present in the commercials I was studying, however, I think that these other also analysis missed quite a bit. The most challenging part was trying to understand my second advertisement (a perfume ad). Because I am not the intended audience, I did not understand some of the messages and subtle visual cues. I had watched the entirety of the ad multiple times trying to reason why each element was present. After a while, I began to realise how they were manipulating natural instincts and desires. I learned that although the ads we see appear to be somewhat random, they are actually made with a lot of thought and meaning.</p>
