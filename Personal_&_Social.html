          <h3>Megafauna Essay</h3>
            <p>Out of all of my assignments at the ASMS, my megafauna essay is one of the best in my opinion. The task was to propose a hypothesis as to why the Australian megafauna became extinct, giving credible, reliable and relevant evidence to back up your claim. I took the stance that it could not be one cause but a mix of both changing climate and human impact. To back up my claim I looked for research both for and against my hypothesis. This allowed me to create well-grounded arguments while also allowing me to know what I need to debunk. Along with debunking counterpoints, I sometimes altered my stance so that the two ideas could go together. I created unique ideas taking parts ideas from a range of researchers and combining them in a logical manner. I concluded that &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gv7gyunqhl0ezlfGfRq7_gSRILFoaXEo8i49ruB0R2k/edit?usp=sharing">drought had driven them to the edge of extinction and humans were the tipping point.</a>&quot; From this essay I learned how to effectively identify and evaluate ideas. I can also combine different perspectives in a logical way.</p>
          <h3>Trial Exams</h3>
            <p>In week seven of term three, I took part in the trial exams. All four of my subjects have a final exam at the end of the year, therefore, I had to do a trail exam for each subject during this week. Before going into the exams I was aware that I would not perform as well as I would have liked due to a number of reasons. First, we did not have time to revise and I knew that I had forgotten most of the content covered at the beginning of the year. The second reason was that we had still not covered everything in the subject. I still had one more topic to go for each subject. The following week I was been given back my trial exams so that I can mark and reflect on them. As expected, I did not do very well in any of my subjects. At first I was a bit concerned by my lack of achievement, however, upon reflection I was able to rationalise it a bit better. I was confident in my ability to do well and the results of the trial exams do not reflect the achievements that I made previously. From this I suspected that it is not expected that students will perform well on these test. Once speaking to peers I found that each one was in a similar position as me. I then spoke to some teachers and from what I gathered, I was correct in my assumption. I was told that the results I received was to be expected and that someone at my level could easily get an A in the exams if I put enough effort into my revision. Therefore, I feel motivated to put all my effort into revising and have the comfort that it is an achievable goal.</p>

          <h3>SIP Planning</h3>
            <p>For SIP (student inquiry project) students needed to create a question that we would develop and explore in depth over the next 20 weeks. Possibly the most challenging part was creating an idea that had enough substance to continue working on throughout the entire timespan. In order to create the question, I began simple by thinking of some topics (such as biology, medicine, etc.) that interested me. In each topic, I looked at whether there were sub&#8208;topics (such as animal behaviour, selective breeding, etc.) that could be expanded on in order to create realistic and worthwhile questions. By doing this I narrowed down my search to just a few possible questions. In the end, I chose to look at goldfish memory. However, I realised that goldfish memory was still very broad. So, I created sub&#8208;questions about goldfish in general that I could add to create a more specific question. I decided to look at how colour plays a role in the development of goldfish memory. I ended up with the question &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BjqNZ6F9sg7FOaT68jC-hOcjPeqk9dAIG_TfF-kibbY/edit?usp=sharing">Can goldfish utilise colour in order to develop memory and how long can they retain that memory?</a>&quot; This practice in brainstorming will continue to help me develop new and creative ideas in the future and will also be useful when starting my RP (research project).</p>
          <h3>Community Gardening</h3>
            <p>On Thursday each, week, the ASMS conducts learning session called adventure space. In year ten I chose to take part in the gardening adventure space. This involved our class designing the ASMS community garden to be self-sustaining. We also had the goal to make sure everything we added to the garden had two or more purposes. For example we planned to create bee hotels which doubled as a grow wall for vines. The next step was to get into the garden and turn these plans into a reality. Because the class was quite big, it was impossible to ensure that everyone was given a role and had the resources needed to carry it out. Therefore, the sessions relied heavily on our ability to be self-directed. This improved my confidence to show initiative. If we were presented with an issue, it was up to us to solve it by ourselves (or in small groups). Because there was two to three people working on each part of the garden we did not have someone constantly checking up on our progress, this meant that there was nothing stopping us from slacking off. However, if we did, it would mean that the overall progress of the garden would slow down. Therefore, we would set personal goals to ensure that we contributed fairly. The final thing that I developed from this adventure space was resilience. Sometimes our plans would not be successful. Therefore, we had to adapt to the situation. This could be by creating a new plan that incorporates what we had already accomplished. However, it was equally important to know when it was best to abandon the original plan as to not waste time/resources.</p>

          <h3>SIP Reflection</h3>
            <p>Another important part of SIP is the reflection. Once I had finished the folio and the outcome of my SIP, I wrote a reflection on the journey and what I had learned along the way. This included developing research skills, practical skills, and evaluation skills. The reflection helped me to understand my personal research and learning methods. Recapping what I learned and did has solidified what I need to prepare for in RP. While writing my reflection, I developed my metacognition. I thought about how I thought throughout SIP. Doing so has allowed me to plan future assignments as I know how I like to go about things.</p>

          <h3>EZ Mug Group Work</h3>
            <p>The largest group assignment that I have worked on so far was an expo task. This task required me to work with three other people in order to design and produce an innovative item or program. Throughout the task it was crucial to have clear and constant communication. Before we could start designing an innovation we needed to find a problem that it can fix. We all contributed a range of ideas and would then add to other group member’s ideas. This was done in a very similar way as finding the problem, each person adding ideas and expanding on them. At times some group member’s would disagree on what was the best approach to complete the work. However, every time this would be solved quickly as each one of us would be able to rationalise and understand the other person’s perspective. Although the group did not have a defined leader, I feel as if I have gained a better understanding in how to manage a group. This is because there were (very few) times in which a group member would become distracted and required someone to refocus them. I also developed my leadership skills when I was explaining important information. I learned how to best present information in a way that suited the specific individual. Evidence of my skill development can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OdY43PYGzVm3D-5SYTdIQIuv33BUb07VQbidup7tQ8Q/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
          <h3>Earth Summit</h3>
            <p>One of my favourite events that the ASMS has conducted was Earth Summit. This even is conducted every second year and involves all year ten and eleven years. We were split into groups of three which each group representing a country. The objective of the event is to respond to a proposal by United Nations committee. It was that no countries should be allowed to export food if they cannot supply enough for their own citizens. My group chose to represent South Africa. We began by conducting research on the economy, trade and the agriculture of South Africa. We only had a few lessons in which to do this, therefore, our group needed to work collaboratively to increase our efficiency. We did not choose our groups. This meant that I had never worked with my group members previously. Despite this, we were able to collaborate affectively as well as support one another. We then had to use the information we found to make a decision as to whether or not we will accept the proposal. We unanimously chose to reject the proposal based on the way our country would have been economically and socially impacted. On the day of the event, we were required to make a three minute repose in front of the UN committee as well as the other country representatives. This required us to communicate our positioning and as well as our reasoning in a clear and affective manner. During this event, all the countries had a dedicated twitter account. The purpose was to debate the proposal. Providing arguments for your position and to rebut points made by opposing countries.</p>
